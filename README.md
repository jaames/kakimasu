###### learn how to write Japanese kana
___

When I started to learn Japanese, I had the most difficulty with the writing system. Japanese uses a mix of two phonetic alphabets (hiragana and katakana), and a few thousand kanji, which are somewhat pictographic. You'll be forgiven if you think that sounds rather overwhelming. (":

I wanted to build an interesting way to learn how to write Japanese kana, utilising modern web technology -- something that I feel other Japanese learning resources are yet to make use of.

For now kakimasu only has hiragana, but I intend to keep working on improving and adding to it. (:


#### Future Plans:

 - [ ] Tweak character animation timings and svgs to get them juuust right
 - [ ] Add [katakana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana) character set
 - [ ] Do proper [feature detection](http://responsivenews.co.uk/post/18948466399/cutting-the-mustard) and display a message or something if a browser is not supported
 - [ ] Add a 'test' feature, i.e. show random characters and users have to guess what they are
 - [ ] Add level 1 [kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji) character set


#### Third-party JS Libraries Used:
