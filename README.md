learn how to write Japanese kana
___

When I started to learn Japanese, I had the most difficulty with the writing system. Japanese uses a mix of two phonetic alphabets (called "Hiragana" and "Katakana") and "Kanji", which are more logographic.

I wanted to build an interesting way to learn how to write Japanese, utilizing modern web technology -- something that I feel other Japanese learning resources are yet to make use of.

For now, Kakimasu only has Hiragana and Katakana characters, however I plan to add basic level Kanji in the future, along with other features. (:
